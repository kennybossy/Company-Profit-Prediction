# Profit Prediction for 50 startups
Project Overview:
Dataset: The dataset contains information from 50 startups, including features such as:
R&D Spend: Investment in research and development
Administration: Administration expenses
Marketing Spend: Budget allocated for marketing
State: Location of the startup (California, New York, or Florida)
Profit: Target variable (profit generated by the startup)
Key Objectives: Preprocess the dataset and handle categorical data.
Implement multiple regression models, including: Multiple Linear Regression models and Polynomial Regression
Compare the performance of different models using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²).
Visualize model predictions and analyze feature importance.
Tools and Technologies: Python for implementation, Pandas, NumPy for data handling, Scikit-learn for building regression models, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization
Conclusion: This project demonstrates how different regression models can be applied to predict a startup's profit and highlights the trade-offs between model complexity, interpretability, and performance.
